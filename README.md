# automata

A collection of projects with cellular automata and fractals. Utilizes the ImGui library for the user interface and DirectX 11 for rendering.
Intended as a learning and experimentation tool.

Includes the following simulations/views:
- Elementary cellular automata
- Life-like cellular automata (including Conway's Game of Life)
- Experimental gradient cellular automata
- Fractal generation (Mandelbrot and related Julia set renders)
